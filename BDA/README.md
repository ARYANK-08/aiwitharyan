# What is Big Data?

- **Big Data** is defined as high volume, velocity, and variety of information assets that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing for enhanced insights and decision-making.
- A collection of large datasets that cannot be processed using traditional computing methods.
- **Examples**: Google, eBay, LinkedIn, and Facebook were built around Big Data Analytics (BDA).
- **Three Pillars of BDA**:
  1. Social Networking
  2. Mobile Computing
  3. Cloud Computing

### Sources of Big Data:
- **Social Networking Sites**: Activity, posts, messages, videos over platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook, etc.
- **IoT Devices**: Smartwatches, Smart TVs
- **Financial Market Data**
- **Web Server Logs**
- **Banking Transactions**
- **Traffic Flow Sensors**
- **Scans of Government Documents**
  
Big Data = Transactions + Interactions + Observations

# Characteristics of Big Data Analytics (5 V's)

### 1. Volume (Quantity)
- A vast amount of data is generated every second/minute.
- **Example**: A Boeing 737 generates 240TB of flight data for a single flight.
- **Example**: Twitter generates 12TB of tweets every day.
- Big data tools use distributed systems to store and analyze data across databases worldwide.

### 2. Velocity (Speed)
- The speed at which Big Data is generated is very fast and it moves around quickly.
- It needs to be processed rapidly.
- **Example**: Over 3.5 billion searches are made per day on Google.
- **Example**: E-promotions: Based on your current location, purchase history, and preferences, you receive real-time promotions for a nearby store.
- **Example**: If you like the PS5 and pass by a Sony store, you might get a real-time notification.
- **Healthcare Monitoring Example**: If a patient's blood pressure is high, immediate alerts are sent to medical professionals.

### 3. Variety (Sources/Formats of Data)
- Big Data comes in structured, semi-structured, and unstructured forms.
  - **Structured Data**: Transactional tables, legacy data.
  - **Text Data**: Unstructured web documents, log files.
  - **Graph Data**: Social networks, semantic web (PDF).
  - **Streaming Data**
  - **Public Data**: Online weather, finance data.
  - **3D Data**: Photos, audio files, video recordings.
  
A single application can generate or collect various types of data.

### 4. Veracity (Trustworthiness of Data)
- With many forms of Big Data, maintaining:
  - Quality
  - Reliability
  - Accuracy
  - Completeness becomes challenging.
  
**Example**: Twitter messages with abbreviations, typos, or hashtags may create data quality issues.

### 5. Value (The Most Important 'V')
- Data in itself is of no use unless it is converted into something valuable.
- **Value** refers to the ability to turn data into insights.
- The one 'V' that matters the most.
- Big Data delivers value in almost every area of society or business.
  - **Example**: Amazon and Netflix recommendations help companies better understand and serve customers.
  - **Example**: Uber uses Big Data to predict demand, dynamically price journeys, and send the closest driver to the customer.
  - **Example**: Law enforcement agencies use Big Data to prevent terrorist attacks and detect cybercrimes.
  - **Example**: Sports teams analyze athletes' performances using Big Data.
