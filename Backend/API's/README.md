# JSON Web Token (JWT) Explained

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an **open standard** (RFC 7519) that defines a compact, self-contained way to **transmit information securely** between two parties as a JSON object. This token can be verified and trusted because it is **digitally signed**. JWTs can be signed using a **secret key** (HMAC algorithm) or a **public/private key pair** (RSA or ECDSA). While JWTs can also be encrypted for additional secrecy, we‚Äôll focus on **signed tokens**, which ensure that the data in the token hasn't been tampered with.

---

## üì¶ **Why Use JWT?**

### **1. Authorization**

JWTs are most commonly used for **authorization**. After a user logs in, a JWT is issued and sent with every subsequent request, granting access to certain resources based on the user‚Äôs permissions.

For example:
- **Real-world scenario:** After logging into Netflix, every request to stream a movie or TV show includes your JWT, allowing access to only the shows you've subscribed to.

### **2. Information Exchange**

JWTs securely transmit information between parties, ensuring the sender is authenticated. The data within the JWT cannot be tampered with because of its signature.

For example:
- **Real-world scenario:** A bank might use JWTs to transfer encrypted data between servers, ensuring the integrity of transactions and preventing any tampering along the way.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **JWT Structure**

JWTs consist of three parts, separated by dots (`.`):
```
header.payload.signature
```

### **1. Header**
Contains the token type (JWT) and the algorithm used for signing (e.g., HS256).
```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

### **2. Payload**
Contains **claims**, which are statements about the user (or other entities). There are three types of claims:

- **Registered claims**: Predefined claims like `iss` (issuer), `exp` (expiration), and `sub` (subject).
- **Public claims**: Custom claims, often used for sharing data, which should be collision-resistant (registered in the [IANA JWT Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/)).
- **Private claims**: Custom claims shared between parties.

Example payload:
```json
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "admin": true
}
```

### **3. Signature**
The signature ensures the token has not been tampered with. It is created by encoding the **header**, **payload**, and a **secret key** or **private key** (in the case of asymmetric signing).

For example, using the HMAC SHA256 algorithm:
```
HMACSHA256(base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload), secret)
```

---

## üîÑ **How JWT Works:**

1. **User Authentication**: After successfully logging in, a JWT is returned.
2. **Token Use**: Every time the user accesses a protected resource (like a server or API), the JWT is sent in the **Authorization header** of the request:
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer <token>
   ```

### **Real-World Example:**
- **YouTube API**: When developers access YouTube's data using their API, they authenticate with a JWT. The token ensures they have valid permissions to retrieve information like playlists or videos.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **Why JWT over Other Tokens?**

- **Compact**: Since JWT uses **JSON**, it is smaller and faster to transmit than XML-based tokens like **SAML**.
- **Versatile**: Works across various programming languages.
- **Secure**: Unlike **Simple Web Tokens (SWT)**, which only use symmetric keys, JWT supports **asymmetric keys** (public/private key pairs) for added security.

## üìà **Conclusion**

JWTs provide a secure, compact, and easy-to-use method for **authorization** and **information exchange** across platforms. They are widely used today for their **scalability** and **security** benefits in handling sensitive data in modern web applications.

# Simplified Explanation of JWT (JSON Web Token)

Imagine there are two different servers: **Bank** and **Retirement**. Both are separate systems, but you, as a user, want to log in and access both of them without entering your credentials every time.

---

## The Problem: Manual Login Every Time

When you log in to your **Bank** server, you can browse your account information. But if you switch to the **Retirement** server, you're asked to log in again. This can be frustrating, especially if both services belong to the same company and you expect seamless access across platforms.

### Example:
- **Scenario**: You log into **your bank** to check your balance. Later, you visit the **retirement server** to check your retirement plan, but you're asked to log in again, even though both servers are part of the same financial company.

---

## The JWT Solution: Seamless Login Across Services

**JWT (JSON Web Token)** solves this problem by storing the login information **on the browser side**. Once you log in to one server (e.g., **Bank**), a JWT is created and stored in your browser. When you visit the other server (e.g., **Retirement**), the JWT is automatically sent, and the **Retirement** server recognizes you and lets you access your account **without asking you to log in again**.

### How It Works:

1. **Login to Bank Server**:
   - You enter your credentials (username, password).
   - The **Bank server** creates a **JWT** and sends it to your browser.
   
2. **JWT Stored in Browser**:
   - Your browser stores the **JWT** securely.
   
3. **Switch to Retirement Server**:
   - When you switch to the **Retirement server**, your browser sends the **JWT** along with the request.
   - The **Retirement server** checks the **JWT** and sees that you're already authenticated.
   - You **don't need to log in again**; the server grants you access.

### Real-World Example:
- **Google Accounts**: When you log into **Gmail**, you can also access **Google Drive** or **YouTube** without logging in again. That‚Äôs because a JWT (or similar token) is being used behind the scenes, allowing all these services to recognize you.

---

## Why JWT is Useful Here:
- **No Multiple Logins**: You log in once, and JWT lets you access multiple services seamlessly.
- **Stored in Browser**: The token is stored safely in the browser, allowing it to be reused when switching between services.
- **Fast and Efficient**: Since JWT is small and compact, it can easily be transmitted with each request without slowing things down.

---

In simple terms, JWT acts like a **magic ticket** that you get when you log in once, and it lets you access multiple services without the hassle of logging in again each time!

## OAuth: Secure Access Without Exposing Credentials

OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard that allows third-party applications to access a user‚Äôs resources (such as their data or files) **without needing to expose their credentials**. Instead of sharing your username and password, OAuth uses **access tokens** to provide secure access.

---

### How OAuth Works:

1. **Resource Owner (User)**: The user who owns the data or resource.
2. **Client (Application)**: The third-party app that requests permission to access the user's resource.
3. **Authorization Server**: Issues the access token after the user grants permission.
4. **Resource Server**: Holds the user's data and validates access using tokens.

---

### Real-World Example: OAuth in Action

- **Scenario**: You‚Äôre using an app that lets you post to **Twitter** on your behalf. You don‚Äôt want to give the app your **Twitter username and password**, so OAuth helps facilitate this in a more secure way.

1. **Step 1: User Grants Permission**  
   You‚Äôre redirected to Twitter‚Äôs login page from the third-party app. After you log in, Twitter asks, "Do you want to allow this app to post tweets on your behalf?" You say **yes**.

2. **Step 2: Authorization Server Issues Token**  
   Twitter (the **Authorization Server**) generates an **access token** and sends it to the third-party app.

3. **Step 3: Accessing Resources**  
   The app stores the token and uses it to make requests to **Twitter‚Äôs API** (the **Resource Server**) to post tweets. The token tells Twitter that the app is authorized to act on your behalf without exposing your login credentials.

---

### OAuth Use Cases

- **Social Media Integration**: Apps using OAuth to let you post on Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn.
- **Cloud Storage Access**: Apps that let you upload files to your **Google Drive** or **Dropbox** without directly asking for your password.
- **Login with Google/Facebook**: Instead of creating a new account for every website, you can log in using your Google or Facebook account. OAuth makes this possible by securely handling your login.

---

### Python Example for OAuth Flow Using `requests-oauthlib`

Here‚Äôs a simple example using Python to request authorization from GitHub:

```python
from requests_oauthlib import OAuth2Session

# Replace these values with your app's settings
client_id = 'your_client_id'
client_secret = 'your_client_secret'
authorization_base_url = 'https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize'
token_url = 'https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token'

# Step 1: Redirect the user to the provider (GitHub) for authorization
github = OAuth2Session(client_id)
authorization_url, state = github.authorization_url(authorization_base_url)
print(f'Please go here and authorize: {authorization_url}')

# Step 2: GitHub redirects back to your site with an authorization code
redirect_response = input('Paste the full redirect URL here: ')

# Step 3: Use the authorization code to fetch the access token
github.fetch_token(token_url, client_secret=client_secret, authorization_response=redirect_response)

# Step 4: Now, the app can access protected resources, like user profile
response = github.get('https://api.github.com/user')
print(response.json())
```

This flow allows a Python app to log in to GitHub on behalf of the user without needing to store or handle the user's password.

## Basic Authentication: The Simplest HTTP Authentication Method

### What is Basic Authentication?

Basic Authentication is a method defined in the HTTP standard (RFC7617) that allows a browser or client to send the user‚Äôs credentials (username and password) to the server. The **credentials are sent as a base64-encoded string** in the HTTP request header.

While it is straightforward, it‚Äôs not the most secure, especially if used without **HTTPS**. The credentials are encoded, but they‚Äôre not encrypted, meaning that anyone intercepting the request can decode them easily.

---

### How Does Basic Authentication Work?

1. **Client Request (No Authorization Header)**:  
   The client (e.g., browser) sends a request to the server. Since it doesn‚Äôt include an Authorization header, the server responds with a **401 Unauthorized** status code and a **WWW-Authenticate** header.

2. **Browser Prompts for Credentials**:  
   Seeing the **WWW-Authenticate** header, the browser shows a login prompt to the user.

3. **Client Submits Credentials**:  
   After the user provides their username and password, the browser encodes them using **base64** and sends them in the **Authorization header**.

4. **Server Validates Credentials**:  
   The server decodes the credentials and checks if they‚Äôre valid. If they are, the server grants access to the resource; otherwise, it returns another **401 Unauthorized** response.

---

### Python Example for Basic Authentication

Below is a simple example of how to implement Basic Authentication in Python using **Flask**:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import base64

app = Flask(__name__)

# Simple method to decode Basic Auth credentials
def decode_credentials(auth_header):
    base64_credentials = auth_header.split(' ')[1]
    decoded_credentials = base64.b64decode(base64_credentials).decode('utf-8')
    username, password = decoded_credentials.split(':')
    return username, password

@app.route('/')
def index():
    auth_header = request.headers.get('Authorization')

    if not auth_header:
        # Return a 401 response with a WWW-Authenticate header
        return (
            jsonify({"message": "Authentication required"}),
            401,
            {'WWW-Authenticate': 'Basic realm="user_pages"'}
        )

    username, password = decode_credentials(auth_header)

    # Check the credentials
    if username == 'admin' and password == 'admin':
        return jsonify({"message": "Hello, admin!"})
    else:
        return (
            jsonify({"message": "Invalid credentials"}),
            401,
            {'WWW-Authenticate': 'Basic realm="user_pages"'}
        )

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### How This Example Works:

1. When the user tries to access the **`/`** route, the server checks if the **Authorization header** is present.
2. If not, it responds with a **401 Unauthorized** and a **WWW-Authenticate header** to prompt for credentials.
3. The user inputs their credentials (e.g., 'admin'/'admin'), and the browser sends the encoded username and password in the Authorization header.
4. The server decodes the credentials and either grants access or responds with a 401 status if they‚Äôre incorrect.

### Key Differences Between OAuth and Basic Authentication

| **OAuth**                                 | **Basic Authentication**                     |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Secure token-based authorization.         | Simple username-password-based authentication. |
| Grants third-party apps controlled access to resources without sharing credentials. | Credentials are sent in every request (base64-encoded). |
| Access tokens can be limited to certain scopes (permissions). | No permission granularity; full access. |
| Commonly used for apps like social media or cloud storage. | Often used for internal or less sensitive systems. |
| Example: Logging in with Google or Facebook. | Example: Authenticating to internal company tools. |

Both have their uses, but OAuth is more secure and scalable for modern web applications!

## CHAPTER 5: Representational State Transfer (REST) - A Deep Dive

This chapter provides an in-depth exploration of the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style, a powerful framework for building scalable and flexible distributed hypermedia systems, with the World Wide Web serving as its prime example. 

### 5.1 Deriving REST: A Constraint-Driven Approach

REST is not built from a rigid blueprint but emerges organically by applying a series of constraints to a system initially free of predefined structure. This incremental approach helps clarify the rationale behind each constraint and its influence on the system's characteristics.

**Step-by-Step Derivation:**

1. **Null Style:**  We start with a clean slate - no constraints, signifying a system without clear component boundaries.
2. **Client-Server:** The client-server constraint establishes a separation of concerns, decoupling user interface (client) from data storage (server). This promotes portability, scalability, and independent component evolution.
3. **Stateless:**  By enforcing stateless client-server interaction, each request from client to server becomes self-contained, carrying all necessary information. This eliminates server-side session state, significantly enhancing visibility, reliability, and scalability.
4. **Cache:** To optimize network efficiency, we introduce caching. Responses are labeled as cacheable or non-cacheable, enabling clients or intermediaries to reuse responses for subsequent equivalent requests, thus reducing latency and server load.
5. **Uniform Interface:**  A defining characteristic of REST, the uniform interface constraint simplifies system architecture by standardizing component interaction. It promotes decoupling, visibility, and evolvability. 
6. **Layered System:** Organizing the system in hierarchical layers, with components interacting only within their immediate layer, manages complexity, promotes flexibility, and allows for intermediaries like proxies and gateways that can enhance security, performance, and translation capabilities.
7. **Code-On-Demand (Optional):**  This optional constraint permits client functionality to be extended by downloading and executing code (e.g., JavaScript), enhancing flexibility and extensibility.

### 5.2 The Building Blocks of REST: Architectural Elements

REST provides an abstract view of distributed hypermedia systems, focusing on the roles of components, the constraints governing their interactions, and the meaning of crucial data elements.

#### 5.2.1 Data: The Heart of Interaction

Data in REST is not hidden within components but is central to the architectural style. It draws inspiration from both client-server and mobile object styles to strike a balance between information hiding, scalability, and rich functionality.

**Key Data Elements:**

| Data Element         | Modern Web Examples                   | Explanation                                                            |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **resource**              | A blog post, a product in an online store  | The conceptual target of a hypertext reference; a key abstraction in REST. |
| **resource identifier** | `https://www.example.com/blog/post123` | A URL or URN used to uniquely identify a resource.                    |
| **representation**      | HTML document, JPEG image, JSON data  | A concrete, byte-stream representation of a resource's state at a moment in time. |
| **representation metadata** | `Content-Type: text/html`, `Last-Modified: ...` | Metadata (headers) describing the representation itself (data format, modification time).|
| **resource metadata**     | `Link: <...>; rel="next"`, `Vary: Accept-Encoding` | Metadata describing the resource, not tied to a specific representation. |
| **control data**        | `If-Modified-Since: ...`, `Cache-Control: ...` | Data influencing message processing (e.g., caching behavior, conditional requests). |

#### 5.2.2 Connectors: Enabling Communication

Connectors in REST provide the mechanisms for accessing resources and exchanging their representations, presenting a consistent interface that hides implementation complexities. 

**Stateless Interactions:**

* A cornerstone of REST, statelessness dictates that each request must be independent and self-describing, simplifying server design, enabling parallel processing, and facilitating intermediary involvement.

**Types of Connectors:**

| Connector | Modern Web Examples                                  | Role                                                        |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **client**    | Web browsers, libraries (`libwww`, `libwww-perl`)  | Initiates communication with requests.                  |
| **server**    | Web servers (Apache, Nginx), server-side APIs     | Listens for and responds to requests.                     |
| **cache**     | Browser cache, CDNs (Akamai, Cloudflare)             | Stores cacheable responses to optimize performance.     |
| **resolver**  | DNS servers (using `bind` library)                 | Translates resource identifiers into network addresses. |
| **tunnel**    | SOCKS proxies, SSL/TLS tunnels                    | Relays communication across network boundaries (e.g., firewalls). |

#### 5.2.3 Components: Playing Their Roles

REST components are categorized based on their function in an overall application action.

| Component      | Modern Web Examples                                    | Function                                                                            |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **origin server**  | Web servers (Apache, Microsoft IIS)                 | The authoritative source for a resource, manages its namespace and representations. |
| **gateway**         | Reverse proxies, CGI scripts, API gateways              | Intermediary imposed by the server or network for various purposes (security, translation). |
| **proxy**           | Forward proxies (Squid), corporate firewalls            | Intermediary selected by the client for performance, security, or other reasons.      |
| **user agent**     | Web browsers, web crawlers (Googlebot)                | Initiates requests, receives responses, and presents them to the user (human or automated). | 

### 5.3  REST in Action: Architectural Views

To understand the collaborative interplay of REST elements, we examine the architecture through different lenses.

#### 5.3.1 Process View: Following the Data Flow

The process view emphasizes the flow of information and interactions between components, highlighting REST's support for independent, potentially parallel processing.

#### 5.3.2 Connector View:  Mechanics of Communication

This view focuses on the mechanisms enabling communication between components.  REST's generic resource interface enables flexibility in protocol choice and facilitates the use of intermediaries.

#### 5.3.3 Data View:  Application State and Performance

The data view reveals how application state is represented and transferred within the REST architecture.

* **Application State is Decentralized:** REST places application state primarily within the user agent, improving server scalability and giving clients more control over state management. 
* **Performance Optimization:** REST optimizes performance through several means:
    * **Minimizing Latency:** Reducing the time between application states (e.g., loading web pages) is crucial. 
    * **Effective Caching:**  Caching plays a vital role in reducing network traffic and latency.
    * **Incremental Rendering:** Designing media types and applications to support incremental rendering (displaying content as it arrives) drastically improves user experience. 

### 5.4 REST in Context: Related Work

This section differentiates REST from other architectural styles, emphasizing its strengths and suitability for specific scenarios.

* **REST vs. Distributed Objects:** REST's resource-oriented approach offers more flexibility compared to the stricter typing and interface definitions of distributed object systems. 
* **REST vs. Event-Driven Systems:** REST primarily uses a pull-based model (clients initiate requests) in contrast to the push-based nature of event-driven systems. This difference is crucial for the Web's scale and performance.

### 5.5 REST: A Foundation for Scalable Hypermedia

REST has proven its value as a robust and adaptable architectural style for distributed hypermedia. Its principles, when applied thoughtfully, contribute to systems that are scalable, flexible, and performant. The next chapter delves into the practical experiences and lessons learned from applying REST in the real-world development and standardization of the Web.

**Introduction to JSON API**

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format used for data exchange between clients and servers. JSON APIs are based on the JSON API specification, designed to streamline communication between servers and clients by using a consistent format for requests and responses.

### What is JSON API?

A JSON API is a standardized format that uses a specific MIME type: `application/vnd.api+json`. This format eliminates the need for custom coding for every server-client interaction, adhering to a strict set of rules to reduce complexity and "chattiness" between client and server. JSON API aims to improve efficiency in data exchange and follows REST principles, adding specific constraints to ensure consistency.

### JSON API vs. REST APIs: Clearing Up the Confusion

There is often confusion between JSON APIs and REST APIs. REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style, while JSON API is a specification that uses REST principles but adds structure through its MIME type. Both use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), but JSON API brings in standardization by defining how requests and responses should be formatted, ensuring that information exchange follows a predictable pattern.

### The "Chattiness" Problem

A typical REST API might require multiple back-and-forth calls to gather all necessary information. For example, imagine a blog site where you need to load an article along with its author and comments. With traditional REST APIs, you might first make a request for the article, then for the author, and then for comments‚Äîresulting in multiple requests.

In JSON API, all this data can be bundled into a single response. JSON API lets you include related resources like author and comments directly within the article data, reducing the "chattiness" between client and server.

**Example: Traditional vs JSON API Approach**

Let‚Äôs say you want to fetch a blog article with its author and comments.

**Traditional REST API:**
1. GET `/articles/{id}` ‚Äì Get the article data.
2. GET `/authors/{id}` ‚Äì Get the author's info.
3. GET `/comments?articleId={id}` ‚Äì Get comments for the article.

**JSON API:**
With JSON API, all this can be fetched in a single request:

```http
GET /articles/{id}?include=author,comments HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/vnd.api+json
```

### JSON API Example Response

Here‚Äôs an example response for an article with its related data:

```json
{
  "links": {
    "self": "http://example.com/articles",
    "next": "http://example.com/articles?page[offset]=2",
    "last": "http://example.com/articles?page[offset]=10"
  },
  "data": [{
    "type": "articles",
    "id": "1",
    "attributes": {
      "title": "JSON:API simplifies my life!"
    },
    "relationships": {
      "author": {
        "data": { "type": "people", "id": "9" }
      },
      "comments": {
        "data": [
          { "type": "comments", "id": "5" },
          { "type": "comments", "id": "12" }
        ]
      }
    },
    "links": {
      "self": "http://example.com/articles/1"
    }
  }],
  "included": [
    {
      "type": "people",
      "id": "9",
      "attributes": {
        "firstName": "Dan",
        "lastName": "Gebhardt",
        "twitter": "dgeb"
      },
      "links": {
        "self": "http://example.com/people/9"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "comments",
      "id": "5",
      "attributes": {
        "body": "First!"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "comments",
      "id": "12",
      "attributes": {
        "body": "I like XML better"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Why Use JSON API?

1. **Reduced Requests**: JSON API reduces the need for multiple requests by including related data (like author or comments) within a single response.
2. **Consistency**: By using a well-defined structure, JSON API ensures that requests and responses are always formatted predictably.
3. **Efficiency**: JSON API allows you to filter, sort, and paginate results in a single request. For example:
   ```http
   GET /articles?include=author&fields[articles]=title,body&fields[people]=name HTTP/1.1
   ```
   This request retrieves articles along with only the `title` and `body` of the articles and the `name` of the author.

4. **Caching**: Clients using JSON API can efficiently cache responses, reducing the number of network requests. This can speed up applications by eliminating redundant data transfers.

### MIME Type: Why `application/vnd.api+json`?

The use of a specific MIME type‚Äî`application/vnd.api+json`‚Äîlets servers know that the client expects a JSON API response. This MIME type distinguishes it from the standard `application/json`, allowing more advanced operations such as sorting, filtering, and pagination, all built into the specification.

### Conclusion

JSON API helps avoid endless debates about response structure by enforcing a clear standard. By following shared conventions, developers can focus on building features rather than reinventing the wheel. The reduction in chattiness, enhanced efficiency, and caching capabilities make JSON API a powerful tool for building modern, scalable applications.

For more details, refer to the full [JSON API specification](https://jsonapi.org/).

---

**Key Takeaways:**
- JSON API uses a specific MIME type to standardize data exchange.
- It reduces chattiness by allowing you to include related resources in a single request.
- JSON API helps improve efficiency by supporting sorting, filtering, and pagination in one request.
