# Simple HTTP Server

# This is a simple HTTP server implemented in Python. 
# It allows clients to send requests for file uploads, echoes strings, retrieves user-agent information, 
# and serves files from a specified directory. Additionally, it supports Gzip compression for responses.

# Features
# - Echo Endpoint: Returns a string specified in the URL.
# - User-Agent Endpoint: Returns the User-Agent string sent by the client.
# - File Uploads: Supports uploading files via POST requests.
# - File Retrieval: Serves files from a specified directory on the server.
# - Gzip Compression: Compresses responses for clients that support it.

# Getting Started

# Prerequisites
# - Python 3.x installed on your system.

# Installation
# 1. Clone the Repository (if applicable):
#    ```bash
#    git clone <repository-url>
#    cd <repository-name>
#    ```
# 2. Save the Server Code: Copy the provided server code into a file named `http_server.py`.

# Running the Server
# 1. Open a Terminal/Command Prompt.
# 2. Navigate to the Directory where `http_server.py` is saved.
# 3. Run the Server:
#    ```bash
#    python http_server.py --directory /path/to/your/directory
#    ```
#    Replace `/path/to/your/directory` with the actual path where you want to serve files from.

# Important Endpoints
# - Echo Endpoint: Returns the string that you send in the URL.
#   - Example:
#     ```bash
#     curl http://localhost:4221/echo/hello
#     ```

# - User-Agent Endpoint: Returns the User-Agent header from the request.
#   - Example:
#     ```bash
#     curl -A "TestUserAgent/1.0" http://localhost:4221/user-agent
#     ```

# - File Upload: Uploads a file to the server using a POST request.
#   - Example:
#     ```bash
#     curl -X POST -d "This is a test content" http://localhost:4221/files/testfile.txt
#     ```

# - Retrieve File: Gets a file from the server.
#   - Example:
#     ```bash
#     curl http://localhost:4221/files/testfile.txt
#     ```

# Code Explanation

# Imports
# - argparse: Used to handle command-line arguments.
# - socket: For creating the server and managing connections.
# - threading: Allows handling multiple client connections simultaneously.
# - gzip: To compress responses using Gzip.
# - io: To manage byte streams for compression.
# - pathlib: For easy manipulation of file paths.

# Main Functions
# 1. response_with_content(content, content_type="text/plain", code=200, compress=False):
#    - Generates an HTTP response with the specified content, type, and status code.
#    - If `compress` is set to `True`, the response content is compressed using Gzip.

# 2. file_response(http_method, path, body, directory):
#    - Handles file uploads (via POST) and retrieval (via GET).
#    - Saves uploaded content to a file and returns its content if it exists.

# 3. response(http_method, path, user_agent, body, directory):
#    - Routes requests to the appropriate handlers based on the requested path.
#    - Checks if the user agent supports Gzip compression and applies it if so.

# 4. parse_request(request):
#    - Parses the incoming HTTP request to extract the method, path, user agent, and body content.

# 5. handle_client(client_socket, address, directory):
#    - Manages the communication with connected clients, processes requests, and sends responses.

# 6. main():
#    - Sets up the server to listen for connections, accepts client connections, and spawns threads for handling them.

# Important Concepts
# - HTTP Methods: The server supports GET and POST methods. GET is used to retrieve resources, while POST is used to send data to the server.
# - Gzip Compression: This server can compress responses using Gzip, which reduces the amount of data sent over the network, improving performance for clients that support it.
# - Concurrency: The server can handle multiple client connections at the same time using threading, allowing for efficient request handling.

# Conclusion
# This simple HTTP server is a great starting point for understanding how web servers work. 
# You can expand its functionality or customize it for your needs.
