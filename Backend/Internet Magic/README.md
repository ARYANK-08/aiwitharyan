# What is the Internet?

**Main link**: [What is the Internet?](https://roadmap.sh/guides/what-is-internet)

The Internet is a global network of computers connected to each other, allowing communication through standardized protocols.

- It consists of a vast number of independently operated networks.
- It is fully distributed, meaning there is no central control.
- Any device can connect with any other device, similar to making phone calls.

## Wires, Cables, and Wi-Fi

Information on the Internet moves in the form of bits over various mediums, including Ethernet cables, fiber optic cables, and wireless signals (radio waves).

The Internet transmits information using binary code (0s and 1s), similar to how the postal service works, but much faster.

- The Internet functions like a postal service for digital data.
- Information is represented as binary code (0s and 1s).
- Data is transmitted using electricity, light, and radio waves.
- Fiber optic cables enable long-distance, high-speed data transfer.
- Wireless signals allow mobile Internet access but rely on wired connections.
- Bandwidth measures data transmission capacity; latency measures delay.
- All Internet content ultimately reduces to binary representation and transmission processes.

- **Binary Code**: Essential for efficient encoding and transmission of digital information.
- **Physical Mediums**: Electricity, light, and radio waves affect data speed and distance.
- **Fiber Optics**: Facilitate high-speed communication with minimal signal loss.
- **Wireless Technology**: Enables mobility but depends on wired infrastructure for long distances.
- **Bandwidth vs. Latency**: Understanding these is crucial for optimizing Internet performance.
- **System Fragility**: The Internet is physically vulnerable; disruptions can impact service.
- **Binary Love**: All Internet content, from emails to videos, is delivered through electronic pulses and light, illustrating technology's role in global connectivity.

## IP Addresses and DNS

Now that you know about the physical mediums for data transfer over the Internet, let’s learn about the protocols involved. How does information traverse this massive global network of computers?

### Network of Networks
- The Internet connects billions of devices globally, facilitated by Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
- Its success relies on protocols, which are rules allowing different parts of the network to communicate.

### Understanding Internet Addresses
- **IP Addresses**: Each Internet device has a unique IP address, similar to a home address. The transition from IPv4 to IPv6 accommodates the growing number of devices.
- **DNS**: The Domain Name System translates user-friendly domain names into IP addresses, simplifying navigation.

### Challenges and Solutions in Scaling
- **DNS Hierarchy and Security**: The DNS is a hierarchical system that faces security challenges, like DNS spoofing, which can redirect users to fraudulent sites.
- **Robust Protocols**: Internet protocols are designed to scale and adapt, essential for managing increasing users and devices.

## Packets, Routing, and Reliability

Information transfer on the Internet occurs in small chunks called packets, which can take different paths during transfer.

- **Data Packets**: Information is sent as packets, similar to letters sent through the mail.
  
- **Role of Routers**: Routers manage the flow of packets across the network, akin to traffic managers on a highway.

- **TCP Protocol**: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) ensures data is delivered accurately, like a reliable mail carrier.

- **Network Structure**: The Internet consists of hundreds of thousands of interconnected networks and billions of devices, similar to streets and houses in a city.

## HTTP and HTML

HTTP is the standard protocol for transferring web pages over the Internet.

- **Web Browsers**: Programs like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge allow you to access web pages.

- **Web Servers**: Web pages are stored on web servers that provide pages to users when requested.

- **HTTP Protocol**: A set of rules that helps web browsers and web servers communicate by sending requests and receiving responses.

- **Data Transfer**: Data moves between computers using TCP (which ensures reliable sending) and IP (which addresses and routes data packets).

- **Security**: SSL and TLS encrypt data sent over the Internet, helping to keep it safe from unauthorized access.

- **Requesting Web Pages**: When you type a URL, the browser requests the web page from the server, which sends it back to be displayed.

- **Web Page Structure**: Web pages use HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.

- **Submitting Forms**: When you fill out a form online, the data is sent to the web server using an HTTP POST request.

- **Cookies**: Small data files stored on your computer by web servers to track your activity and personalize your experience.

- **Secure Connections**: A padlock icon indicates that SSL or TLS is protecting data exchanged with a secure website.

## Encryption and Public Keys

Cryptography keeps our communication secure on the Internet.

### Key Points on Internet Encryption and Public Keys
- **Open System**: The Internet allows the exchange of private data (like credit card numbers) over shared connections.
- **Encryption**: This process scrambles data to keep it secret, while decryption reverses it to make it readable.
- **Caesar’s Cipher**: An early method of encryption that shifts letters. For example, encrypting "hello" with a shift of 5 gives "mjqqt."

- **Modern Encryption**: Current secure communications use 256-bit keys, making it nearly impossible for computers to crack them.

- **Key Length**: Longer keys significantly increase the number of guesses needed to crack a cipher.

- **Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption**:
  - **Symmetric**: Both sender and receiver share the same secret key, requiring secure private agreement.
  - **Asymmetric**: Uses a public key for encryption (shared) and a private key for decryption (kept secret), allowing secure communication without sharing a private key.

- **Public Key Cryptography**: Enables secure messaging and is fundamental to protocols like SSL and TLS, which protect web browsing.

- **Secure Browsing**: Indicators like the padlock icon or "https" in URLs show that public key encryption secures data exchange.

- **Future of Encryption**: As internet usage grows and computers get faster, developing new encryption methods will be crucial to maintain security.

## Cybersecurity and Crime

Cybersecurity refers to protective measures against criminal activity on networks and the Internet.

### DNS Analogy
DNS is like a phonebook on your mobile phone. Just as you can call someone using their name, DNS allows you to browse websites by translating domain names into IP addresses. Your browser needs the IP address to open a website, similar to how your phone needs a number to make a call.
