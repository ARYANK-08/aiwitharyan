## What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the **on-demand** delivery of computing power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources via the internet with a pay-as-you-go pricing model. It enables you to shift from thinking of infrastructure as hardware to thinking of it as software.

### Cloud Service Models
- **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service)
- **PaaS** (Platform as a Service)
- **SaaS** (Software as a Service)

## Why Cloud Computing Came into Existence
Before cloud computing, organizations managed their own racks and servers on-premises. This approach had several challenges:

- **Underutilization of Resources**: Resources were often not fully utilized.
- **Scalability Issues**: Scaling instantly was challenging and required guessing future usage.
- **High Maintenance Costs**: Managing hardware and software infrastructure was a costly and time-consuming task.

Cloud computing was developed to address these issues, offering a more flexible, scalable, and cost-effective solution.

## Cloud Service Models

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
Provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or dedicated hardware), and data storage space. It offers the highest level of control over IT resources.

**Example**: Using Amazon EC2.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Removes the need to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems). Focuses on the deployment and management of your applications.

**Example**: Using Elastic Beanstalk.

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
End-user applications are delivered over the internet.

**Example**: Slack, Gmail.

## Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

1. **Pay-as-you-go**: Pay only for the amount you consume, reducing hardware and maintenance costs.
2. **Eliminate Guessing Capacity**: Scale on demand, avoiding over-provisioning.
3. **Increased Speed**: Access resources quickly and efficiently.
4. **Stop Spending on Racks and Stacks**: No need to maintain data centers.
5. **Go Global in Minutes**: Deploy your application in multiple regions worldwide.
6. **Massive Economies of Scale**: The shared infrastructure model reduces costs for everyone.

## What is a Web Service?
A web service is any piece of software that is available over the internet and uses standardized formats like JSON or XML for request and response between applications.

- **EC2**: Complete control over AWS resources.
- **Lambda**: Run code without managing servers.
- **Elastic Beanstalk**: Deploy, manage, and scale web apps.
- **Lightsail**: Lightweight cloud platform for simple web apps.
- **Batch**: Process hundreds of thousands of batch workloads.
- **Outposts**: Extend AWS infrastructure to on-premises data centers.
- **Fargate**: Implement containers or microservices architecture.

## AWS Pricing Model

- **Compute**: Charged per second, varying by instance type.
- **Storage**: Typically charged per GB/hour.
- **Data Transfer**:
  - Outbound data is aggregated and charged per GB.
  - Inbound data transfer has no charge.

## Traditional Infrastructure vs. Cloud Computing

| Traditional Infrastructure | Cloud Computing |
|----------------------------|-----------------|
| Equipment | No upfront expense |
| Resources and administration | Pay for what you use |
| Contracts | Improve time to market |
| Costs | Scale up and down |
